# Batocera Backup Service

A script for [Batocera](https://batocera.org/) to back up your data to cloud storage using [rclone](https://rclone.org/).

It's tested and works with Batocera [v40](https://batocera.org/changelog) and rclone's [OneDrive provider](https://rclone.org/onedrive/). Other providers very likely work just as well, they just haven't been tested by me. Open an issue if you run into one that doesn't work.

The script has two modes:

* [Automatic](#automatic): using Batocera's [services](https://wiki.batocera.org/launch_a_script#services) feature, it periodically uploads your saves in the background.
* [Manual](#manual): by running the script manually, you can do a full backup of your data.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Steam data is currently not backed up by this script. Only the [saves handled by Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/account/remotestorage) are saved outside of Batocera.
>
> **Background**: since [Steam on Batocera](https://wiki.batocera.org/systems:steam) is installed using [Flatpak](https://wiki.batocera.org/systems:flatpak), it's data is structured differently than the other systems. All game data, not just saves, is stored in the `/userdata/saves/flatpak` directory, which is currently ignored by the script.

## FAQ

### Can I use this script to keep Batocera installs on multiple devices in sync?

No. rclone can upload **or** download files to/from a cloud storage. This script only does the former. rclone's [bidirectional sync](https://rclone.org/bisync/) feature is currently in beta. As soon as that changes, this script will be most likely updated to take advantage of it. Until then, [Syncthing](https://wiki.batocera.org/syncthing) is the best solution for this use case.

### Can I use this script to back up to the same cloud storage from multiple devices?

Yes. If you'd like to do that, make sure you configure the [destDir](/backup#6) variable to point to a different directory for each device to avoid collisions. Otherwise they'd overwrite each other's files that are named the same.

## Setup

1. Copy the [backup](/backup) script to your Batocera installation's `/userdata/system/services` directory.
2. Modify the [configuration](/backup#L3) at the top of the file according to your needs.
3. Follow the steps in one of the methods [here](https://rclone.org/remote_setup/) and set up a remote with the name `backup`.
4. Enable the service with `batocera-services enable backup`.
5. Restart Batocera or use `batocera-services start backup`.

## Usage

### Automatic

Refer to the [Batocera wiki](https://wiki.batocera.org/launch_a_script#services) to learn how to manage services.

### Manual

To do a manual backup: `bash services/backup manual`

This does a full backup including not just saves, but your configuration (`batocera.conf`), ROMs and BIOS files. Use this after modifying any of those.

## Development

Open this repository in VS Code and install the [workspace recommended extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_workspace-recommended-extensions), so the script can be [automatically copied](/.vscode/settings.json#L6) to the Batocera machine on save.

Local dependencies that need to be installed for the copying to work: `sshpass`, `scp`.
