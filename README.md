# PÃ©ter's Batocera Scripts

A collection of scripts I use to enhance my [Batocera](https://batocera.org/) setup.

## Development

Install [workspace recommended extensions in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_workspace-recommended-extensions), so the scripts can be [automatically copied](/.vscode/settings.json#L6) to the Batocera machine on save.

Local dependencies that need to be installed for the copying to work: `sshpass`, `scp`.
